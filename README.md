# Pentenetration Testing Scripts

This repository contains a collection of scripts that I have created for various pentest projects . Each script is designed to perform a specific task and can be used independently or integrated into other projects.

## login_bruiteforce.rb
This Ruby script is designed to perform a brute force attack on a web application's login system. Please note that using such a script for unauthorized access is illegal and unethical. Ensure that you have proper authorization before attempting to use this script.

#### Prerequisites

- Ruby installed on your system

#### Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the script's directory:

   ```bash
   cd <script-directory>
   ```

3. Run the script with the following command:

   ```bash
   ruby login_bruiteforce.rb <target-url> <username>
   ```

   Replace `<target-url>` with the URL of the login page and `<username>` with the target username.

4. Review the output to see if a password was discovered.

#### Important Notes

- **Legal and Ethical Considerations:** Ensure that you have proper authorization before using this script. Unauthorized access to computer systems is illegal and unethical.

- **Security:** Be cautious when running this script, and be aware of the potential consequences. Brute force attacks can have serious legal implications.



## dictionary_bruiteforce.rb

This Ruby script is designed for performing a brute force attack on a web application's login system using a list of passwords from a specified file. Please note that using such a script for unauthorized access is illegal and unethical. Ensure that you have proper authorization before attempting to use this script.

#### Prerequisites

- Ruby installed on your system

#### Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the script's directory:

   ```bash
   cd <script-directory>
   ```

3. Run the script with the following command:

   ```bash
   ruby dictionary_bruteforce.rb <target-url> <username> <password-file>
   ```

   Replace `<target-url>` with the URL of the login page, `<username>` with the target username, and `<password-file>` with the path to the file containing the list of passwords.

4. Review the output to see if a password was discovered.

#### Important Notes

- **Legal and Ethical Considerations:** Ensure that you have proper authorization before using this script. Unauthorized access to computer systems is illegal and unethical.

- **Security:** Be cautious when running this script, and be aware of the potential consequences. Brute force attacks can have serious legal implications.


## ihs-python.py
Build my own tool based on scapy for Idle Host Scan

#### The Goal
This script automates an idle host scanning based on Scapy.
With this script we can thus discover the open ports on a target machine by Idle Host Scanning.

#### Riquirements:
- To do the tests you would need three virtual machines.
- Have 'scapy' installed on the attacking machine.

#### Idle Host Scanning

As demonstrated by the diagram above, the target hosts responds differently to the Zombie depending on port state. 
If the probed port is open, the target sends a SYN|ACK to the Zombie. 
The Zombie does not expect this SYN|ACK, so it sends a RST back. 
By sending the RST, the Zombie causes its IPID sequence number to increment. 
The real attacker detects this in step 3. If the port is closed, the target sends a RST to the Zombie. 
Zombies ignore this unsolicited RST packet and do not increment their IPID sequence number.

#### Scapy
Scapy by secdev is a powerful Python-based interactive packet manipulation program and library.
If you want to know all the protocols used, it will be enough to launch scrapy in CLI, to carry out the command ls(IP)
It is able to forge or decode packets of a wide number of protocols, send them on the wire, capture them,
store or read them using pcap files, match requests and replies, and much more.
It is designed to allow fast packet prototyping by using default values that work.

#### Example usage and expected output:

  $ sudo python fileName.py 192.168.1.100 192.168.1.200 80

In this example, the script is run as root, and the command-line arguments provided are:

- zombieIP: 192.168.1.100
- targetIP: 192.168.1.200
- targetPort: 80

Output:

```bash
  Scan 192.168.1.200 port 80 using 192.168.1.100 as zombie
  Zombie initial IP id is:  12345
  Zombie final IP id 12347
  Port 80: is open
```
   

In this example, the script successfully scans port 80 of the target IP (192.168.1.200) using the zombie IP (192.168.1.100) and determines that port 80 is open.

Please note that port scanning without permission can be illegal and unethical. Always make sure you have proper authorization before conducting any scanning activities.
